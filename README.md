# Proxima Network : A network of connected AI computers

Since the year 2020, when I got into the whole world of Generative AI, I had one big struggle. Finding a good, reliable and affordable infrastructure. In the process of making [Mann-E](https://mann-e.com) I could find tons of web service/cloud providers which were good and reliable but not really affordable and this is not really a surprising fact at all. GPU's are god damn expensive. Since models were open source and built by me, using API's wasn't an option unless someone hosts the models somewhere and give me access to the API.

So since I had a huge interest in _Web 3_ and _Bitcoin_ as well, I took a page from their book and tried to make something very similar to a blockchain but for computers which are running AI network. Why? Because there is a good chance that you, the person who is reading this page right now, have an NVIDIA card and you also were curious about [Ollama](https://ollama.com) and have it installed as well. So why not sharing the model with other people? and probably monetize your resources? 

The whole goal of _Proxima Network_ is to let you give other people access to your resources and get rewarded by the network. This repository will be a monorepo for both _Tunneling Tool_ and _Resource Sharing Scripts_. The super node will be closed source until we find a good way to have multiple of them and then it'll become open as well.
